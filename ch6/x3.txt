Five C++ constructs for which the meaning is undefined:
	- attempt to assign to an array address that is out of bounds
	- signed integer overflow
	- null pointer dereference
	- more than one modifications of the same scalar in an expression
	  that are unsequenced
	- access to an object through a pointer of a different type.

Five C++ constructs for which the meaning is implementation-defined:
	- the type of std::size_t
	- the number of bits in a byte
	- the text of std::bad_alloc::what
	- default number of buckets in unordered_map
	- diagnostic message.

The "Index of implementation-defined behaviour" of the international
standard lists many more.
