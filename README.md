# Exercises from The C++ Programming Language

My solutions to [exercises](https://www.stroustrup.com/4thExercises.pdf) from the book.

I discovered the useful clang format tool while doing the last exercise
for chapter 8. Code of exercises prior to that is mostly consistent with
the style appearing in the book.

## List of exercises that require more thinking to solve fully

* Chapter 8 second part of exercise 5: implement ++ and -- operators for the code
  version using `<locale>`
* Chapter 10 exercise 13: convert the mini-compiler written by Bjarne to allow a
  user to define functions; perhaps invent a notation for functions taking parameters
* Chapter 11 exercise 3: make apply function take function object as argument.
