/* What does the above example do?
 * Integer variable n gets the value count + 7 divided by 8. If (count + 7) is
 * not divisible by 8, the result gets truncated. If n modulo 8 is zero, it
 * increments addresses to and from by one, and then to gets the value of from.
 * This happens eight times, because of absence of break statements and
 * resulting fallthrough.
 *
 * Perhaps I really should verify that analysis using a debugger, but it is
 * horrible enough just to rewrite anyway, independent of its correctness. And
 * also adding back that comment stating its intent.
