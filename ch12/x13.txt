This occurs in the book (p. 167):
using PF = int(*)(double); // pointer to function taking a double and returning an int

This is found in cpprefrence (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias):
using func = void (*) (int, int);
void example(int, int) {}
func f = example;

The short "all caps" name makes it clear that it is a type alias. So does the second
example.  But what if we needed aliases for pointers to different kinds of functions?

using PFID = int(*)(double); // pointer to function taking a double and returning an int
using PFIS = int(*)(string); // pointer to function taking a double and returning a string

using func_vii = void (*) (int, int);
using func_vs = void (*) (string);
