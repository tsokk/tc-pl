I chose GNU ed to be the "simple C program" to convert to C++.
It is in repo https://github.com/tsokk/ed

The combines with -Wall flag without errors. However, the tests
fail, seemingly due to segfault.

I made the conversions of exercise 5. However, removing naked
news and deletes (exercise 6) would mean more work, which
is likely to exceed the time estimate given for the exercise.
I'll therefore postpone completing that exercise, and move on.
