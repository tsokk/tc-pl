The standard library header files are kept in (default installation) location:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.28.29910\include"

See x1.cpp for the list of all public headers in the above directory.  The list contains
deprecated and experimental headers, all of which can be included with <> notation.  Including
these (<hash_map>, <hash_set> and <experimental/filesystem>) will cause warnings to be emitted
by the compiler.  The warnings can be silenced to acknowlegde the receipt of the warning.  This
is done by defining macros, as instructed by the warning text emitted by the compiler.

As an aside, I have also boost installed.  They reside in another directory and must be included
with "" notation.  An include directive is also required to indicate their location to the linker.
